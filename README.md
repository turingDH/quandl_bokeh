Familiarizing myself with [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) api for 'wiki/prices' daily volume and close data; thought it would be interesting to join with other Quandl/Zacks quarterly macro and fundamental data and develop some interactive Bokeh html.

Would like to deploy via flask once satisfactory.


Current status:  have missing daily data points for several ticker symbols; considering GOOG finance, but as of Feb 2018, it is said to be unreliable.  Also missing some quarterly earnings data.  Perhaps directly from FRED is better.
